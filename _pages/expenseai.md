2. Cannot find invoices when you need.
3. No insights of monthly or yearly expenses.

Advantages:

1. Complete insights of all data.
2. Powered by cloud, you can access your data anywhere and anytime.
3. Powered by state-of-the-art AI algorithms that can automate data streamlining from invoices, no need of manual entry.
