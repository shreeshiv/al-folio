Wonderer and Wanderer is how I describe myself. My name is Shreeshiv, entrepreneurship zealot and technology optimistic. I am software engineer by profession. Currently I am technology analyst at Deutsche Bank. I earned Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Nirma University. During summer 2019, I did an internship at Microsoft, where I worked on a project of Ad Automation at Bing Ads. 

In my leisure time, I love to explore about new technologies and playing football. Ohh, I am also learning photography, just few months back I purchased camera and it’s really fun learning.:)

[I love to read books of different genres ranging from technology to fiction.](/reading/) I fascinated with ‘Steve Jobs’ by Walter Issacon, ‘How to win friends and influence people’ by Dale Carnegie, ‘Zero to one’ by Peter Thiel, 'The innovator's dilemma' by Clayton Christensen,  and many others. 

I am optimistic about AI and its real world applications. I always want to build such product that can solve real-world problems using cutting edge technology. I decided to work on product to store and organize all invoices at one location, I call it [expense.AI](/expenseai/). You can download demo application that I built as a prototype of a product on [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tufanProtocol.onboardscreen)
