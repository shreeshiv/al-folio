  abstract={Recent proliferation in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning allows us to generate OCR models with higher accuracy. Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is the process of extracting text from documents and scanned images. For document data streamlining, we are interested in data like, Payee name, total amount, address, and etc. Extracted information helps to get complete insight of data, which can be helpful for fast document searching, efficient indexing in databases, data analytics, and etc. Using AIESI we can eliminate human effort for key parameters extraction from scanned documents. Abstract Information Extraction from Scanned Invoices (AIESI) is a process of extracting information like, date, total amount, payee name, and etc from scanned receipts. In this paper we proposed an improved method to ensemble all visual and textual features from invoices to extract key invoice parameters using Word wise BiLSTM.},
